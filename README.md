## Libraries

### KSPromise
I use this promise library because of familiarity. It's been a staple promise library for me. I use promises because I think it's the most sophisticated and object-oriented way to do asynchronous callbacks

### AFNetworking
I use AFNetworking because it helps abstract away many of the annoying networking undercarriage (such as managing NSURLSessions) and works nicely with KSPromise. I've never not used AFNetworking on any serious objective-c app.
